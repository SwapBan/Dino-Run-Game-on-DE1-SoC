To **play a WAV file on your DE1-SoC FPGA using the 3.5mm audio jack**, the **easiest and fastest method** is to use the **Linux-side `aplay` command** with a supported Linux image and properly configured audio driver for the **Wolfson WM8731 codec**.

---

### ✅ Easiest Method: Use `aplay` with the default DE1-SoC Linux image

#### **Step-by-step instructions:**

---

### **1. Prepare a Compatible Linux Image**

Use the default **DE1-SoC Linux image** provided by Terasic that has audio drivers pre-configured.

**Download DE1-SoC Linux Image:**

```bash
wget https://www.terasic.com.cn/downloads/cd-rom/de1-soc/DE1-SoC_Linux_FBSD_20200806.tar.gz
```

Unpack it:

```bash
tar -xzvf DE1-SoC_Linux_FBSD_20200806.tar.gz
```

Flash it to your SD card:

```bash
sudo dd if=DE1-SoC_FB.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M conv=fsync
sync
```

> Replace `/dev/sdX` with your actual SD card device (e.g., `/dev/sdb` — be very careful here).

---

### **2. Boot the FPGA with the SD Card**

* Insert the SD card back into the DE1-SoC.
* Power it on.
* Connect to the board via UART or SSH (`root@de1soc` prompt).

---

### **3. Test the Audio Driver**

Run:

```bash
aplay -l
```

You should see a **"Wolfson WM8731"** or similar card listed.

If you don't see it:

* Confirm that the audio codec is wired/connected properly.
* Your Qsys design must include the **audio core** and the **I2C controller** for configuring the codec.

---

### **4. Copy a WAV File to the Board**

From your host PC:

```bash
scp yourfile.wav root@de1soc.local:/root/
```

(Replace `yourfile.wav` with the path to your WAV file.)

---

### **5. Play the Audio**

```bash
aplay yourfile.wav
```

> Make sure the WAV file is 16-bit, 44.1kHz PCM stereo/mono — the Wolfson codec supports standard formats, but keep it simple.

---

### ✅ Tips:

* Use headphones or speakers via 3.5mm jack (not line-in).
* Confirm that the codec's I2C configuration logic is included in your Verilog or Qsys design.
