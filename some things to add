Increased Difficulty (Speed and Obstacles)
Hardware Timers: Use the on-chip timers on the DE1-SoC to control the speed of the game. You can dynamically increase the speed of the obstacles by adjusting the timer intervals based on the playerâ€™s score.

Increase the difficulty by adjusting obstacle speeds using hardware counters to simulate progressive difficulty.


Power-Ups and Special Abilities
For power-ups, you could implement them with hardware logic to modify the dino's properties (e.g., make it invincible for a short period) when the player collects a power-up. Implement collision detection for power-ups using FPGA-based comparators.
